Description: Physiological Contribution in Spontaneous Oscillations: An Approximate Quality- Assurance Index for Resting-State fMRI Signals

For validating the sensitivity of the proposed PICSO index (a new quality-assurance index for rs- fMRI) to functional connectivity, both fMRI dataset of phantom and human during resting state were acquired. The resting-state human dataset (n=12, age: 26.4 ± 2.1 y, females/males: 6/6) was acquired at four image resolutions (1.3×1.3×2,2×2×2,3×3×3,and5×5×5mm^3). Moreover, a spherical water phantom was scanned using identical imaging protocols. Besides, T1-weighted structural images and B0 field map were acquired as well.
